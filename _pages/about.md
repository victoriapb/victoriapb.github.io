## About

I am a Senior Pharmacometrician at the Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometics Organization at [AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG](https://www.abbvie.de/) in Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany. Prior to AbbVie, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Saez-Rodriguez Group](http://saezlab.org/) at the Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Heidelberg University Hospital, Germany. I completed my PhD in Applied Mathematics at [Heidelberg University](http://www.uni-heidelberg.de) under the supervision of [Thomas Carraro](https://numerik.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/~carraro/?page_id=119) (Institute for Applied Mathematics, IWR, Heidelberg University), [Tomás Alarcón](https://sites.google.com/site/tomasalarc/home) (Centre de Recerca Matematica, Barcelona, Spain), [Philip Maini](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/maini/) and [Helen Byrne](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/helen.byrne) (Wolfson Centre for Mathematical Biology, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford).


## Research Overview

My research focuses on formulating mathematical and computational models for understanding diseases and treatment response. My previous work has mostly focused on cancer dynamics and scratch assays. I am particularly interested in:
- Developing multi-scale models that can integrate cross-scale mechanisms and clinical outcomes of diseases.
- Linking models and experimental data through parameter estimation and model selection.
- Combining mathematical frameworks with computational, statistical and machine learning methods to formulate predictive clinically relevant models.
