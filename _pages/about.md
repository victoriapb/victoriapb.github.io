## About

I am Postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute for Computational Biomedicine (Saez-Rodriguez Group)](http://saezlab.org/), Heidelberg University Hospital, Germany.

My research focuses on formulating mathematical and computational models for understanding diseases and treatment response. My previous work has mostly focused on cancer dynamics, while currently I am working on kidney fibrosis. I am particularly interested in:
- Developing multi-scale models that can integrate cross-scale mechanisms and clinical outcomes of the disease.
- Linking models and experimental data through parameter estimation and model selection.
- Combining mathematical frameworks with computational, statistical and machine learning methods to formulate predictive clinically relevant models.

Prior to Saez-Rodriguez Group, I did a PhD in Applied Mathematics at Heidelberg University under the supervision of Thomas Carraro (Heidelberg), Tomás Alarcón (Centre de Recerca Matematica, Barcelona), Philip Maini and Helen Byrne (Oxford).
