## About

I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the Computational Biomedicine group ([Saez-Rodriguez Group](http://saezlab.org/)), Heidelberg University Hospital, Germany.

My research focuses on formulating mathematical and computational models for understanding diseases and treatment response. My previous work has mostly focused on cancer dynamics, while currently I am working on kidney fibrosis. I am particularly interested in:
- Developing multi-scale models that can integrate cross-scale mechanisms and clinical outcomes of the disease.
- Linking models and experimental data through parameter estimation and model selection.
- Combining mathematical frameworks with computational, statistical and machine learning methods to formulate predictive clinically relevant models.

Prior to Saez-Rodriguez Group, I did a PhD in Applied Mathematics at [Heidelberg University](http://www.uni-heidelberg.de) under the supervision of [Thomas Carraro](https://numerik.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/~carraro/?page_id=119) (Heidelberg), [Tomás Alarcón](https://sites.google.com/site/tomasalarc/home) (Centre de Recerca Matematica, Barcelona), [Philip Maini](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/maini/) and [Helen Byrne](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/helen.byrne) (Oxford).
