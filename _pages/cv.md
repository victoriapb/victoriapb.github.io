## Work experience

* 2020-Present: Pharmacometrician at AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG, Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany.
	* Application of different modeling and simulation approaches to explain pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic dynamics based on clinical trial data.

* 2019-2020: Postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Heidelberg University Hospital, Germany.
	* Formulated, analysed and simulated a multiscale model of cell communication between macrophages and fibroblasts. 
	* Calculated spatial statistics of experimental images through an image processing pipeline (using bash and python). 
	* Integrated data from different experiments to a mathematical model through a computational pipeline to improve model predictions.

* 2015-2019: Doctoral researcher at the Institute for Applied Mathematics, Heidelberg University, Germany.
	* Constructed an image processing pipeline (using C++, bash and Matlab) that processes experimental data, performs image segmentation and does a statistical analysis of migration measurements extracted from the experimental data.
	* Developed a graphical user interface for the statistical analysis of cell migration data.
	* Improved mathematical models of in-vitro cell dynamics by improving the description of cell migration and proliferation. 
	* Created an algorithm  in C++ that couples a finite element discretisation and stochastic compartmental description of a reaction diffusion system.
	* Examined finite element discretisations for solving reaction diffusion equations in C++.
	* Worked closely with both wet and dry lab scientists from five international laboratories. 

* January 2015-July 2015: Master research student at the Wolfson Centre for Mathematical Biology, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, UK.
	* Designed, implemented and analysed a new stochastic model to quantify tumour response to radiotherapy taking into account sublethal damage.
	* Assessed the predictivity of different tumour response models to radiotherapy using deterministic representations and stochastic individual-based simulations. 

* June 2013-August 2013: Undergraduate summer researcher at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics, University of California, Los Angeles, USA.
	* Together with three undergraduate students, UCLA academics and a researcher from Symantec Corporation, we performed a cryptoanalysis of an encrypted search scheme.
	* Developed information leakage models to quantitatively measure vulnerabilities of the encryption scheme.
	* Facilitated possible security pitfalls of Lucene index under various attacks and advised future improvements of the proposed scheme.
