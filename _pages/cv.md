## Work experience

* AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG, Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany.
	* May 2021-Present: ***Senior Pharmacometrician***
	* August 2020-May 2021: ***Pharmacometrician***
	* Application of different modeling and simulation approaches to explain pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic dynamics based on clinical trial data.

*  Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Heidelberg University Hospital, Germany.
	* August 2019- July 2020: ***Postdoctoral researcher***
	* Formulated, analysed and simulated a multiscale model of cell communication between macrophages and fibroblasts.
	* Calculated spatial statistics of experimental images through an image processing pipeline (using bash and python).
	* Integrated data from different experiments to a mathematical model through a computational pipeline to improve model predictions.

* Institute for Applied Mathematics, Heidelberg University, Germany.
	* August 2015- December 2019: ***Doctoral researcher***
	* Constructed an image processing pipeline (using C++, bash and Matlab) that processes experimental data, performs image segmentation and does a statistical analysis of migration measurements extracted from the experimental data.
	* Developed a graphical user interface for the statistical analysis of cell migration data.
	* Improved mathematical models of in-vitro cell dynamics by improving the description of cell migration and proliferation.
	* Created an algorithm  in C++ that couples a finite element discretisation and stochastic compartmental description of a reaction diffusion system.
	* Examined finite element discretisations for solving reaction diffusion equations in C++.
	* Worked closely with both wet and dry lab scientists from five international laboratories.
